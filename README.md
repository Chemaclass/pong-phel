# Terminal Pong in Phel

This repository now includes a small terminal version of **Pong** written entirely in [Phel](https://phel-lang.org/).
It is rendered directly in the console using a lightweight renderer inspired by [`phel-cli-gui`](https://github.com/Chemaclass/phel-cli-gui), so no external runtime is required.

## Running the game

```bash
./vendor/bin/phel run src/pong.phel
```
